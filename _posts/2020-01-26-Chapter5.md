To better understand how multiple regression works in the Bayesian
world, Iâ€™m going to step through the example described in \[Statistical
Rethinking\]
(<a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019" class="uri">https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019</a>)
aka my favorite stat book ever. The problem

``` r
library(rethinking)
data(WaffleDivorce)
d <- WaffleDivorce
# standardize variables
d$A <- scale( d$MedianAgeMarriage )
d$D <- scale( d$Divorce )
```

need to see if stuff is collapsed

``` r
m5.1 <- quap(
alist(
D ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
mu <- a + bA * A ,
a ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.2 ) ,
bA ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.5 ) ,
sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
) , data = d )
```
