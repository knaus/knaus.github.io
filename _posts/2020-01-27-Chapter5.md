A linear regression model helps us understand how much extra
information, apart from what we can already know, can be gained by
knowing an additional predictor variable. To better understand how
multiple regression works in the Bayesian world, I’m going to step
through the example described in [Statistical
Rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019) aka
the most amazing stat book ever.

The Waffle Divorce data set from Chapter 5 has the divorce rate (D),
marriage rate (M) and median age at marriage (A) for each of the 50
states. I’d like to know how much does it help knowing the marriage rate
or the median age at marriage if I’d like to predict divorce rate.

Here’s how the data we’re working with looks like,including the
variables we care about: divorce rate (D), marriage rate (M) and median
age at marriage (A).

``` r
library(rethinking)
data(WaffleDivorce)
d <- WaffleDivorce
head(d,5)
```

An initial plot shows a possible association of divorce rate (D) with
marriage rate (M) or median age at marriage (A) separately.

At the beginning of the analysis we standardize the variables. They’ll
have a mean 0 and SD 1. Let’s check that the divorce rate is
standardized and taka a look at how this variable is distributed.

``` r
d$A <- scale( d$MedianAgeMarriage )
d$M <- scale( d$Marriage)
d$D <- scale( d$Divorce )
mean(d$D)
```

    ## [1] -3.169351e-16

``` r
sd(d$D)
```

    ## [1] 1

``` r
dens(d$D)
```

The linear model below describes what information we have to predict the
mean of the divorce rate D for each observation. The parameters betaM
and betaM describe the influence of knowing the predictor variables M
and A on what we predict for D. The letter i (subscipt i in stat
textbooks) means that the model here applies for every row of data
(observation) we have. For every Marriage rate (M) and Median Age at
marriage (A) observations we have (let’s say 20 and 31), we can draw
parameters alpha, betaM and betaA from their distributions and calculate
a value for the mean of the divorce rate. With the mean of the divorce
rate and the sigma at hand, we have a full description of the likely
values for divorce rate (the distribution of the divorce rate being
normal), from which we can draw a value for Di. This is the prediction
side, once we know the joint probabilities for all the parameters. When
we fit the model, we figure out (well, automatically aka the computer
finds the solution for us) which parameter distribution gives us values
of Di which are closest to the ones we see in the data with rows of
divorce rate, marriage rate, median age at marriage values.

Di \~ Normal (mui, sigma) mui = alpha + betaM \* Mi + betaA \* Ai alpha

Exponential

``` r
m5.1 <- quap(
              alist(
                    D ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
                              mu <- a + bA * A ,
                              a ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.2 ) ,
                              bA ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.5 ) ,
                              sigma ~ dexp( 1 )) , data = d )
```
