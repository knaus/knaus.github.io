# About

So you want to know more about who's responsible for this blog? 

I'm a data scientist at EtiqAI, a startup that helps companies evaluate how fair are the prediction models they use. For example, is your company using a model that is less likely to predict that a woman will repay her loan? I worry a lot about what kind of mistakes machine learning models make, and how I can fix them.  

Before working in data science, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. I studied a group of neurons that are in an ancient part of our brains (the brain stem). What's interesting about these neurons is that although they are very few (on the order of thousands), they send projections to the entire cortex (on the order of millions of neurons). While studying what information is encoded in these neurons and what effect they have on information processing in the cortex, I became very interested in the current developments in artificial neural networks. And here we are. 

In the dark ages known as my PhD, I also tried to understand how the brain works. Instead of looking at neurons firing and trying to guess what information they might be encoding, I analyzed the chemical soup that all neurons bathe in using mass spectrometry. I found a chemical marker for impulsive behavior and learned a lot about experimental design and establishing causality. 

Overall, I [found some stuff about the brain](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H9Vd50IAAAAJ&hl=en). Worked with some amazing people, ate good food, whined on a bunch of hiking trails, changed my last name etc.
